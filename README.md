# Time converter app

## Idea

To create a small but excellent time converter app which displays multiple times at the same time.
I built something simple and contained to develop my knowledge of new technologies,
as well as fully tested, accessible and responsive.

I will used the lessons learnt here to build larger scale apps with the same principles.

## Main tech used

- date-fns-tz: a library inspired by moment.js but easier to use
- React
